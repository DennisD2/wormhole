Bugs
----
- X calculation of cursor is wrong again (due to some unknown change), needs to be fixed


Wish list
---------
- Download data (setup, acquisition) to device. Needs change of GPIB-Controller code.

- Scrollable navigation view (better than several sub dialogues)

- Add to cursor info: delta time to trigger pos

- Ability to write data back to the Tek (e.g. new group names etc.)

- Ability to print out sequential data values. e.g. decoding RS232 data, ISP and more.

- Ability to print (parts of the) canvas. E.g. "all" or "between cursor X and Y".   

- Add code to save a part of the view as JPEG/... image

- Enable to display two-timebase acquisitions (using correlation data array -> looks complicated)


Done
----

- Support chained acquisitions

- There is no automatic redraw after having loaded data from tek device

- Support glitch data

- Add code to receive and handle service requests, e.g. user key press on tek (acq mem upload etc.) 

- Ability to load and save memory images.

- Add cursor functionality. 2-4 cursors, dragable and display of delta time between cursors, 
between cursor and trigger, printout of value (hex, bin, dec etc.) at cursor.
Issue: how to create a dragable object that does not destroy the original content of the canvas?

- Ability to directly load from Tek device via RS232 and GPIB. Buttons "Load AC mem from Device", 
"Load Setup mem from Device". rename old "Start" Button to "Load from file".

- prlword is wrong for higher bits. Needs analysis. Example:
Sequence step 2: Timebase 1, action: wait for: 11001100XXXXXXXX101010XXXXXXXX10XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ,
     to occur 1234 times, filter: 5, with Storage: true
Here, the string "...X101010XXXXXXXXXXX..." should be "...X10101010XXXXXXXX10XXX..."

- Maybe the numbering of group bit ids is wrong (I use Pod bit ids which can be different from group bit id). 
Needs study of manual and trying it out if this is a real error.
